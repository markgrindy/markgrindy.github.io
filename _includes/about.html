        <p>I believe in a co-writing process that affirms your role as the author of the ideas we develop together. </p>

        <p>As your writing partner, nothing is more important to me than understanding how you think. I interview you to hear where you stand and identify where you want to go. I conduct research to build out your narrative. I take the first pen to bring your vision to life. And from there, I work with you to improve each revision until you say it feels just right.</p>

        <p>I've proven this process with keynote speeches delivered under white-hot stage lights and personal toasts shared in the most intimate settings. I've used it to create opinion pieces, book chapters, and blog posts that readers find meaningful and memorable. And I've had a lot of fun along the way.</p>

        <p>If that sounds like what you have in mind, then weâ€™re already on our way to being of one mind. Don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to write with you.</p>
