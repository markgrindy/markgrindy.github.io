        <p>For more than a decade, Mark has collaborated with decision makers in the C-suite, scientists working toward breakthroughs, and start-up entrepreneurs building the next big thing. His writing has appeared in major publications, including <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>VentureBeat</em>, and <em>Vox</em>. His words have been delivered to crowds at the CES main stage, to shareholders at Fortune 500 annual meetings, and swing voters tuning into cable news. Gwen Ifill has quoted from a book without knowing he crafted the text, and there's a nonzero chance you've done the same. </p>

        <p>As a senior director at West Wing Writers, the preeminent speechwriting and strategy firm of the English-speaking world, Mark partnered with nonprofits to reinvigorate supporters, union leaders to rally members, and business leaders to refocus global organizations. He worked with investors to recruit the right entrepreneurs—and vice versa. He supported performers known for their memorable characters as they shared their own hopes, reflections, and inspiration. And he joined with politicians from competing parties to tell the story of how they found common ground. </p>
